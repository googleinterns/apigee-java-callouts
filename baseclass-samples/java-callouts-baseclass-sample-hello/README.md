# Apigee Java Callouts Base Class Sample - Hello

This sample is a simple proxy that uses a Java callout policy demonstrating
usage of the Java Callout Base Class.

This sample proxy produces a message using the given `"name"` and `"message"`
properties. Take a look at the Java source code to see how we get these property
values. 

Note that since `"name"` is an optional property, the proxy will still work
without a `"name"` value whereas the `"message"` is required and will throw an
exception if it is missing. 

Also note that the initial value for `"name"` is a flow variable reference and
that the base class allows us to automatically resolve this reference. 

## Initial Setup

An Apigee account is required to deploy these sample proxies. You can sign up
for a free trial account [here.](https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up)

You also need to have [Python](http://python.org/getit/) on your system to use
the deployment tool.

The project is configured to be compiled using
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), but `javac` will also work.

To begin, checkout this project to your system.

Next, you must set up your deployment environment:

1. Open the file `../../setup/setenv.sh` in a text editor.

2. Edit the file with your Apigee Edge account settings and save it. For
example:

```
org=myorg
username=jdoe@example.com
url="https://api.enterprise.apigee.com"
env=test
api_domain="apigee.net"
```

## Deploying the proxy

1. `cd` into the `callout` directory and compile it using Maven with the command
`mvn clean package`. This compiles the project and copies the jar file into
`apiproxy/resources/java/`. If compiling using `javac`, you will need to move
the jar file manually. 

2. Execute the `./deploy.sh` script. Note you will need
to have set up your `../../setup/setenv.sh` file first. 

3. Once the deployment
succeeds, you can call the proxy using `./invoke.sh`.  

4. The response should
look like this: `Hi Alice! Happy Birthday`.

## Further Details

The name Alice is taken from the `"name"` query parameter. You can change this
in `invoke.sh` to something else or even remove the query parameter entirely.
Inside the proxy properties fields the value for `"name"` is actually
`{request.queryparam.name}` which is a flow variable reference that our callout
is able to resolve. 

The other property we have is the `"message"` which contains `Happy Birthday`.
You can change this as well to modify the response.
