# Apigee Java Callouts Base Class Sample - Exception

This sample is a simple proxy that uses a Java callout policy demonstrating usage of the Java Callout Base Class.

This sample proxy raises an exception that we store in a flow variable for further inspection. It also makes use of the `log` functionality to log a message which is also stored in a flow variable for debugging purposes.


## Initial Setup

An Apigee account is required to deploy these sample proxies. You can sign up for a free trial account [here.](https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up)

You also need to have [Python](http://python.org/getit/) on your system to use the deployment tool.

The project is configured to be compiled using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi), but `javac` will also work.

To begin, checkout this project to your system.

Next, you must set up your deployment environment:

1. Open the file ../../setup/setenv.sh in a text editor.

2. Edit the file with your Apigee Edge account settings and save it. For example:

```
org=myorg
username=jdoe@example.com
url="https://api.enterprise.apigee.com"
env=test
api_domain="apigee.net"
```

## Deploying the proxy

1. `cd` into the `callout` directory and compile it using Maven with the command `mvn clean package`. This compiles the project and copies the jar file into `apiproxy/resources/java/`. If compiling using `javac`, you will need to move the jar file manually.
2. Execute the `./deploy.sh` script. Note you will need to have set up your `../../setup/setenv.sh` file first.
3. Once the deployment succeeds, you can call the proxy using `./invoke.sh`. 
4. The response should return an error, which is expected.

The `setExceptionVariable` method stores the exception, error and stacktrace into flow variables named `callout_exception`, `callout_error`, and `callout_stacktrace` respectively. You can inspect these values by downloading the trace on the Apigee API Proxies portal.

The `log` method allows us to store a message in the `callout_log` flow variable for debugging. This can also be seen in the trace and should contain our message `"Log statement before exception thrown"` along with the line number, class and method where the message was logged. Note that subsequent calls to `log` will not overwrite previous log messages and all will be saved to the same flow variable.
